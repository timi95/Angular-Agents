# My current understanding of vectors


* A vector is an arrow with both Direction (angle in degrees/ radians) and magnitude (length of the arrow in pixels)

* You can also picture a vector as a point because its only properties are X and Y coordinates.

* Assuming a starting position (0,0) a vector Vector(40,70) would draw a line from point(0,0) to point(40,70)
